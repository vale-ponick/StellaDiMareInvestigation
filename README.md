"Sometimes the most complex mysteries are solved by simple arithmetic" - J. Chmielewska

# 🕵️‍♀️ StellaDiMare Investigation 

**Analysis of the yacht "Stella di Mare" route based on Joanna Chmielewska's novel "What the Deceased Said"**

## 📖 About the Project
A detective project recreating the calculation of the transatlantic voyage of the yacht "Stella di Mare".  
Goal: **Mastering Swift language vocabulary and logic** through solving a navigation task from a classic detective novel.

## 🌊 Investigation Route
- **Start:** Paranaguá, Brazil (latitude: -2.5, longitude: -44.3)
- **Waypoint:** Dakar, Senegal (latitude: 14.7, longitude: -17.5)
- **Refueling:** Caribbean Islands (latitude: 18.2, longitude: -66.1)  
- **Finish:** French Coast (latitude: 43.3, longitude: 5.4)

## 💻 Technical Goals
- Working with **structures** (struct) in Swift
- Using **arrays** and **loops**
- Implementing **navigation logic** 
- Mastering Swift **syntax and terminology**

## 🧭 What We Need to Determine
- Was there enough fuel for the actual route?
- Where should secret refueling have occurred?
- Do the captain's statements match the calculations?
